Flutter Starter, as the name suggests, is a starter kit for Flutter that helps you bootstrap projects with all the essential modules like **State Management, API calls, Style Guide,** etc. It helps you build production ready apps in a jiffy. Handle everything at one place so you don't have to rewrite code.

## Motivation

Flutter gives us a simple counter app on installation which works if you are just starting out. However, while building a production-level app, we need state-management, API calls, Styleguide and common widgets. We frequently repeat this code in every project.

Flutter Starter is based on the **DRY principle. Don't Repeat Yourself** is a programming principle that is aimed at reducing repetition and redundancy. 

>:bulb: The **DRY principle** states that "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system".

Why is this useful? Applying the DRY principle helps code maintainability, improves development efficiency and much more!
